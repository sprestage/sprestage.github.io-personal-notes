### these notes aka this journal
Sometime over the last year, github changed gists so they only display the first 700-750 lines of a gist.  The rest are there, but not easily accessible.  For my purposes, they are also not searchable, which makes gist no longer useful for my purposes.  Additionally, I've been needing to update how I maintain my tech blog and my journey blogs as they are using Octopress which these days is very out of date.  Changing over to Jekyll, markdown, and github pages for this daily notes page is my first step towards that change.  Also has the advantage of giving me one place where I can have links to each type of notes pages I like to keep:

### CURRENT TASKS
- [ ] Dev notes, personal.  Set this up in Pages.
- [ ] Dev notes, professional.  Set this up in Pages.

Needs a little updating to convert it to my current needs, particularly that of creating the prioritized list of things needed to be done or bought
- [x] buy more Montelukast, allergy pills.  Tasked Jean with this.  Probably will arrive tomorrow Monday, 4 Oct.

It turned out that Jorge still hasn't paid his portion.  This is after SIX months.  Jean paid a portion of this and all of my portion.

Last minute car rental at the end of the day.  Bringing back sometime mid-morning on Sunday.  Erg.


## Thu, 15 Jul 2021
### office containers
Exciting day.  The containers are arriving at the business property.  Long story short, the landlord raised the rent on the guy storing them, so he needs to move, which means so do the containers.

### POS deposit questions
YIKES!  Need to contact POS rep at the bank to figure out how to release a deposit.  Also check on how long a hold is maintained...is it there until released or does it auto-release after a certain amount of days.  If it auto releases, how to I handle a long rental, like 1, 3, or 6 months?

Message sent to Carlos and we are conversing back and forth to teach me what to do.  

### Kai's mental health
Kai opened up to me the other night about how he is struggling with his mental health, in particular with depression and with anger management.  I've reached out the the gal who did his psych eval for school to get a recommendation for a therapist for youth with very good English.


## Mon, 12 Jul 2021
- [x] DOM - shower
- [x] KSR - 8am car rental pickup at Valle Escondido
- [x] PRO - update LinkedIn with OCP and non-availability
- [x] PRO - update PowerToFly with OCP and non-availability
- [x] DOM - paid iPhone
- [x] KSR - prepare document for Fanny, with logo <- IMPORTANTE
- [ ] KSR - REFUND DEPOSIT!!! <- IMPORTANTE

Phone details:

I used the phone number and pay account tab to pay for each of these:

- [x] DOM - 311020190000 = business phone, 6393-2521. paid $13.83, 12/07/21, service/account #1678356 (in email receipt of payment)
- [x] DOM - Susan's phone, 6330 5175, paid $28.39, 12/07/21, service/account #1678296 (in email receipt of payment)
- [x] DOM - 311019100000 = Kai's phone (I think), 6671-8724, paid $62.66, 12/07/21, service/account #311019100000 (in email receipt of payment)

I have confirmed that all three PA phone accounts are up to date for payment.  :D

On 18 June, account #1638746 was paid $74.48.  I *think* this is the house internet.  I see another payment mentioned in these notes on 4 July as well.  Thing is, the 18 June payment has this in the email note: "Pago Contrato +Móvil", so I'm not sure which payment this is except that these notes say I paid all the phones plus the internet on 4 july...however this was a post that looked like a catch-up after a week of no posts, so I'm not sure how current those checked items were.

Here is hoping next month's payments and emails will help all this become more clear.  Good research today, just a bit more needed.

Uh, wow!  That was fast, fast.  One Click Politics offered me a job at 80k before the end of Friday.  Apparently Maged really liked our interview and wanted me as one of the 4 new people.  Time to wrap up the job search and email everyone the news.

- [x] JOB - chat with Kaitlin Lockwood with JumpSmart talent who has a Backend Software Engineer for an international financial services company based in San Francisco role available; 1pm by phone
- [x] JOB - meet with Maged from One Click Politics at 11am by Zoom
- [x] JOB - immediately after the chat with One Click Politics, phone Dan Voigt at his office (I sure do hope the Google Voice works for this!)

- [x] DOM - pay for Kai's psicologia appointment
- [x] DOM - some laundry
- [x] DOM - put away clothes into the closet
- [x] DOM - clean more shoes

Questions for Maged from One Click Politics:

- What does a team look like in your company?
- How do you regularly sync up with a team and across teams?  Daily or weekly stand ups?
- How big is the engineering department and how is its diversity?
- What are the politics like within the company?  In the sense that this is a passionate group of folks with strong ideals that are often different, so how does that play out in the office?

4 existing; hiring 3

I went into this interview concerned that the company would be East Coast, right leaning, with uncomfortable politics.  I was also concerned because this is listed as a senior role.  I came out of the interview feeling like politics will be polite, the engineers are mostly left leaning geeks like myself.  They will definitely be happy with my diverse range of skills.  And it sounds like their tech and where they are going tech-wise is a good fit.  I'm definitely interested in going forward and told Maged (OCP) and Dan Voigt (G12 Staffing) the same.


Next up is my phone meeting with Kaitlin Lockwood with JumpSmart Talent who has a Backend Software Engineer for an international financial services company based in San Francisco role available.  

- what is their tech stack
- is full time remote possible, with 1-2 weeks spent in office every 3 months more or less?

ruby/rails

Full time & remote.  branch.co

Had a great 30 minute interview with Mike DeWolf from User Interviews.  They do things in many ways very like Sportsrocket in all the good ways, including the coding interview.  He said we'd be going forward and would try to schedule the coding interview for next week.  The coding interview is a pull request prepared for the interview.  This is followed by an architecture/design interview where you work together to design a solution for a technical problem.

Had a good 30 minute interview with Pal from Bitwise.  Notes from call:

Build and scale company in general.  Eng provides products to help operations scale.  manage clients, tool for ops to trade and manage portfolios, no business tooling currently, data pipelines that clean then enable analysis.

It does sound like they are looking for someone of diverse experience, but some weaknesses (like my front end work) are fine too.  He needs to check about me being out of the country and asked for a written writeup that he can use to check up with legal.  I'd need to be interested in learning crypto technology (Bitcoin, Etherium, et al) which sounds cool to me.  The next step would be a longer call with his CTO to test my skills, then a half day where we collaborate on a piece of work, which I find to be a splendid way to see if we can work together.

- [x] DOM - wash the tupperware from clearing the fridge
- [x] JOB - update ruby on tech blog and deploy to new Heroku stack; ok, this has turned out to be more involved than I'd hoped.  Which in some ways is good as it will refresh my skills for how to put together a blog site checked into github and deployed to Heroku.  The first complication is that the ruby used in my old blogs is 2.2.1.  The Heroku stack that can support ruby that old is end-of-life by 2 years.  The next complication is that octopress hasn't been maintained since 2015.  Jekyll, the base for octopress, is still being maintained.  As I understand it, the pretty style of my current blogs is because of octopress, so I'll have some porting of code to do in order to affect the same look and feel, or roughly so anyway.  Need to make tasks for this.  

Ashley, FB:

She needs to talk to folks about the Panama aspect since I'd need to be fully remote except occasional trips north.  This isn't usually ok, but it may be time for that to change and for me to lead the charge on this.  Her contact is out, so she'll try to get back to me by Friday but definitely by early next week.  If all works out, the next steps would be:

- 45 min tech (coding interview)  CS fundamentals  (mock interview videos, actual mock interview w/ feedback, material reviews)
- the full interview, 2 coding, 2 architecture/design, 1 cultural

Facebook works hard to prepare candidates for the technical interviews ahead of time so all are able to shine to the best of their abilty.

Spoke with Dan Voigt about the company.  Sounds like a great fit.  They may be concerned that I live outside of the US.  He will speak to them further.  Company called One Trick Root or One Trick Politics.  They start with an interview w/ director, then do a 15-20 min code exercise.  If that goes well, they schedule a virtual team meeting for introductions and testing culture/tech fit.  Dan will contact me tomorrow morning with an update.

- [x] DOM - took care of Little Bit
- [x] DOM - went to Jungla Panama with Kai
- [x] DOM - took nap

Even more underslept after only 2.5 hour naps all night between feedings.  Little Bit is showing good strength and energy when he's awake.  Still no elimination.  I watered down the formula mix by third feeding yesterday at Heather's recommendation.  Once or twice mid or late feeding he grasps the tiny syringe and takes a good drink.  His nuzzling around is a clear indicator of a wish and preference for nursing from mom, sadly to no avail. Upon hearing the story, Adelina said her son knew of a wildlife rescue, Jungla Panama in Palmira Centro, only 10 mins away.  Contact made with Dorothy on WhatsApp.  Sent her a picture so she knew that Little Bit was a black squirrel, or Variegated Squirrel which have a mutation for black in western Panama.  

I figured less than an hour there and then return.  Over two hours later, we got into the car for me to realize I had missed my Spanish lesson completely.  Whoops.  Jungla was amazing.  Sweet old tiny blind pony, dogs, many many cats, ducks, goats, a turtle, 3 macaws and a smaller green parrot of some sort, two different owls, an adult female squirrel who had formerly been someone's pet so can be released, a kinkajoo, a couple of small fish, and 2 monkeys.  The squirrel didn't like to be pet, but was perfectly willing to sit up on any part of you while eating sunflower seeds.  Quite expert at hanging upside down in the awesome enclosure that I hope Little Bit will live to grow up in while preparing to be a wild squirrel.

Underslept today.  At 3am, I heard the first baby squirrel.  At 4am, I rescued the uninjured 2nd baby squirrel, Little Bit.  He was warm by 6am for first feeding.  Feeding every 2-3 hours with milk replacer I had on hand from Sunsinger's failed litter.  No elimination yet in spite of much stimulation with qtip, warm washcloth, and warm bath for his lower body.  Becomes physically quite active during elimination attempts and feeding time, he has good strength for his size and age.  I'm hopeful.  Ended day with nearly 1cc milk consumed at each feeding.  Cute little burring sound.  When he's done feeding he curls into a ball for his next long nap.  Very age appropriate.  Contacted Tamra and Heather early on and their advice concurred with all I'd been reading in the wee hours while Little Bit was warming up in my palm tented with soft warm flannel.

Here I am one week later.  No applications out to potential jobs yet, though I have done some searching and have found some likely candidates I need to apply to.  I've spent this time diving back into code and AWS and rake task scripting in the process of getting the Unofficial Trakehner DB site back up.  This site is the best example of my skills, so I felt it was important to get it back into a viewable condition.  I have everything working locally, with images and thumbnails and horses imported.  Now I'm working on getting it all deployed to Heroku.  Once that is done, I first need to freshen my resume up on my Portfolio site.  Then I need to update LinkedIn and a few other sites with my current job interests, SDET or QA or dev, plus my updated resume.  Then the search can begin.  Should be ready by Friday, I think.  Depends on how the Portfolio deployment goes.  Other side projects need to include getting the journey and the technical blogs deployed on new stacks.  This will mean upgrading the octopress blogs from ruby 2.2.1.

I have a spaghetti sauce plan to implement today.

Take a good look at Defiant, https://www.defiant.com/employment/.  Even better, they are based out of Seattle!!  Found them on Jooble and they are also on WeWorkRemotely which I also find to be a good sign.  I watched their video and they seem like a smart, geeky, and fun group of people that I would work and play well with.  They provide a security solution for WordPress installations.  The skill set they are looking for very much aligns with my experience...except for actual WordPress and PHP.  I'm hoping my OctoPress experience will help with the lack of WordPress and that my bash scripting will make up for the lack of PHP.  They like diverse people and experience, so it may well be very worth crafting a good response to their application.

Spent the last 3 hours making the spaghetti sauce then Alanna complains when I toss her the paper to clean up the dead bird in the shower.  Feh!  She really adds to the work around here.  The benefit for Kai is worth it, but I see the cost for me in both efforts on her behalf, increased workload around the house and food prep, and increased grocery cost.  

In other news, outstanding effort from Kai on sumativas today.  Only PE remains.

I'm about done in for the day though.  Tomorrow I need to move and wash the cars.  Then jump on the resume updating and applying to Defiant.

## Sat, 22 May 2021
Moved all the cars in preparation for the big weed whacking this morning.  Worked with Kai the open the cabinet above the pantry.  This is going to need a woodworker, Saul?, to come in and fix so it opens well.  Supported Kai in cleaning this cabinet, then storing all the good suitcases.  Made him a coffee cake as a reward.  Did some initial website searches to get a feel for where to run my job search.  Definitely looking for a Dev Test position.  Part time or short term may be the best choice but I'll keep my options open especially since I can pay folks to run the business while I'm working full time.

In other news, Chiriquí province is back to full lockdowns on Sundays, with curfew from 8pm - 4am.  Fortunately, as of yesterday, the curfew was pushed to 10pm - 4am.  The hospitals are out of beds and 46% of the cases country-wide are in Chiriquí.  Also, anyone leaving the province must present a negative Covid test taken in the last 24 hours.  I'm keeping a close eye on this as Alanna is departing for the US in one month.  I hope she can afford plane tickets back since I have no money for her return.  I'll keep my fingers crossed.


## Fri, 21 May 2021
Started the day very early, 5:45, I think.  Shower and a good breakfast.  Spent the morning clearing all boxes out of the way in my room and the hallway.  Then put away every stray item in my room.  Confirmed size and planned placement of everything around the house.  Cleared the corner near the kitchen for the bar.  Directed Adelina in the clearing of everything for the piano.  Ran support for all the details as each item of furniture was brought up and placed in my designated locations.  Didn't move the waterbed since all the soft parts are still in the US.  Also didn't move the smaller pieces for now.  Fell over for naps for much of the day afterwards.  Discovered that the dresser drawers still stink of the fumigation so removed them all and have the fan at full blast.  I hope to be able to start using the dresser on Sunday.  Or Tuesday at the latest.


## Thu, 20 May 2021
Hoping to get some actual work done tomorrow, Friday.  First need to list all my tasks, which needs to include running to the bank for cash and paying everyone.  Eeeek.  Also need to get up early and finish measuring and planning locations for furniture.  Adelina is due to arrive at 9am and Saul is due to arrive around 10am with Danny.

Today I did all the grocery shopping at 4 different shops, then froze the chicken in bags.  Still need to separate and freeze the beef.  I also did a pile of dishes as well as cleaning many things out of the fridge, taking all that out to the compost, then washed them all.  This all left me quite thrashed.  Then spent the evening with Kai finishing all the math sumativa.

Yesterday, I went out and bought 2 tanks of gas, washed many loads of clothes, washed dishes, made food, then helped Kai most of the day to catch up on old sumativas and translating as needed.  Also, spanish class with Columba

Spanish learning:

anolis o lagarto o lagartija o moracho  =    anole or lizard or lizard or moracho

# TRANSITION

18 May 2021, 6:30pm

Looking back in this journal, I see that I mostly stopped in June of 2019.  That is the point where loans were begged for from friends and solved by Keith Reynolds.  A low point indeed.  In September of 2019, the ranch finally sold and financial woes ended.  Since then I've slowly gotten the company going and finally rented out the first car about a month ago.  I gave up on the computer industry due to finally hitting an endpoint in the struggle against being female, needing remote-only work, and being considered old at 50.  

I went full out working on starting my business.  Property rented, plans architected, shipping containers converted into offices, 7 vehicles carefully selected (mostly) and purchased.  This brings us to March of 2020 and the pandemic.  Three moves later for various reasons, spending a huge amount of time supporting Kai in online schooling at his new school at the academia, shipping everything to Panama from storage in the US, moving Alanna down here for much of the year to support Kai through adolescence, and an infinite number of delays on the work at the business property all bring me to May of 2021.  Nearly out of money.  I think we'll be able to squeek through this low point, but it is tight and scary.  These last few months saw much of the last of my money put into getting our new home rental into a livable state.  

We are living in an old hostel which is a lovely large place with 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, an entryway that is already a good office for the business.  We moved in a few days before the beginning of April and things are slowly coming together nicely.  The furniture is airing out in the deposito downstairs and will be placed around the house on Friday.  We have 8 cats!  2 are our babies gotten near the beginning of the pandemic.  6 are fosters that started out super shy but are doing well after a year of steady love.  Finding them homes will be difficult as there was a pet population boom in Boquete as the pandemic closed the large spay/neuter clinics for many months.  Kai, the cats, and I are all loving the immense outdoor space we enjoy here.

Finally to the point.  I've observed that this type of journaling of tasks, accomplishments, thoughts, ideas, and planning was a very good one while I was in the computer industry and also as I was job searching.  I would like to start tracking again since I have many balls in the air trying to keep up with:

- Kai's academic needs (AIB)
- Business tasks, ideas, planning, etc. (KSR)
- Spanish learning (ESP)
- Household everything (DOM)

I think that covers everything.  Ah yes.  The other big reason I feel like I should keep this journal is I often feel at the end of a day, at the end of a week, in the middle of the night, and sadly at the end of the year, like I haven't accomplished anything.  I feel like I'm busy all the time and am sure I'm getting an enormous amount done, but it is very hard when looking backwards to see what I've accomplished.  A journal shows those accomplishments with undenyable clarity.  :)

Subject: Recommendations for dentist, gum specialist, and crown replacement.
Hi Sela,

I am looking for recommendations for various teeth and gum related work.  Al mentioned that you might have some good ideas.  Boquete or David doesn't matter since there are both much closer than Seattle.

I have some gumwork that I've been putting off and am looking for a good professional for this work here in Panama.    

I also have a crown that will need replacement soon if you know someone good for that.  

And finally, I'm also looking for a dentist that is good with someone with sensitive teeth and has a very gentle hand with the novocaine needle when cavities need to be filled.  This last would be for me and Kai both.

I appreciate any information or ideas you have.

Thank you so much,

Susan

Subject: Aviso de Operación por vender cosas pequeñas.

Hola Fanny

Buenos días. ¿Cómo estás? Gracias por el trabajo que ha realizado para ayudarme a comenzar mi empresa.

Leyendo el Aviso de Operación, veo que es solo para el alquiler de autos. Me gustaría obtener un segundo Aviso (o agregar al primero) el permiso para vender cosas pequeñas como bebidas, bocadillos, flores y otras cosas que los visitantes que acaban de llegar a Boquete podrían necesitar ahora que tienen un automóvil para usar .

Avíseme si tiene alguna pregunta o inquietud.

Gracias por tu ayuda,


Hello Fanny,

Good morning.  How are you?  Thank you for the work you have done to help me start my company.  

Reading through the Aviso de Operacion, I see that it is only for the rental of cars.  I would like to get a second Aviso (or to add to the first) the permission to sell small things like drinks, snacks, flowers, and other things that visitors who have just arrived in Boquete might need now that they have a car to use.  

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your help,

Susan Prestage

- slack for usual communication
- confluence for wiki
- basecamp used for "standup" to accomodate location/timezone differences
- sometimes need to stay late or early to collaborate across continents
- moving from rails to IoT
- use a lot of docker for local environments

Received acknowledgement from Spin that application was received.

Jilt has closed the position through PowerToFly.  Best indicators suggest this is a no.

PowerToFly is dry at the moment.  Moving on to WeWorkRemotely.

Research in WeWorkRemotely turn up these good potentials:  Upstack, Nomadix, Allovue, TaxJar, maybe WeaveUp (DevOps plus some backend)

It looks like SyncroMSP (the company that Jen Wolfe pointed me towards, through craigslist) is still hiring.  I'm working up an email now and answering the questions they included in the advert.

```
I am a mid-level ruby on rails developer with senior level experience in test and the computer industry in general. The last couple of years have given me the chance to create APIs from the design document stage through deployment and support of our client's use and requests for additional features and bugfixes.  While seeking my next position, I am in the early stages of designing an API to track power outages in my area, with a frontend to give folks a way to submit outages by neighborhood and date/time as well as display outages over time.

My last three jobs have involved remote work.  The first two were entirely remote for all employees.  The most recent one allowed me to convert to remote after working in the office for 22 months.  I consider myself a lifelong learner and enjoy picking up new skills and ideas.  I would love a chance to chat to see if we might be a good match.

Looking at the snippet of the log file, am I correct in my interpretation that the first line returns a column named "ONE" with a single row of data that contains only the number "1" and no further data?  I also think that the following lines are trying to sort a single item, indicated by the "LIMIT 1".

Found Spin, www.spin.app, on PowerToFly.  No indication of company culture on their website, so I'm omitting that in my cover letter.  The job looks like a good match for my skills.

I think I may apply to UserTesting directly, eventually, since Brian fell down on this so hard.  I should email Brian and Jonathon and ask what happened.

Craig responded and has transferred $2000 in addition to $400 that is my split of the remains in the joint account.  This helps with all my immediate needs.  I'll get the phone up and running in the morning.

Kai is doing well on exams so far.  Much time is being spent on translating and helping him study for each day's exams.

Found another company, just posted to WeWorkRemotely 2 days ago.  They are hiring for a contract/hourly position.  As it happens, they are also in Seattle.  Their website is pretty spare with no company culture, values, or jobs posted to the site.  The only way to apply is through email, jobs@caregrove.com.

NationBuilder cover letter"
```
Good afternoon,

I found you through the WeWorkRemotely site and very much like the company culture I'm seeing in your website, particularly the vision of Jim Gilliam (I am sorry to hear of his loss).  I am a mid-level ruby on rails developer with senior level experience in test and the computer industry in general. The last couple of years have given me the chance to create APIs from the design document stage through deployment and support of our client's use and requests for additional features and bugfixes.

NationBuilder answer to "Tell us why you're a good fit for the job and which NationBuilder value you identify with the most and why."

```
I believe I am a good fit for NationBuilder for a number of reasons.  I love to learn new things.  Smaller teams and the opportunity to pair with others is something I look for in a company.  Handling ambiguity and identifying different ways to solve a problem is something I am very comfortable from both my developer and testing backgrounds.  The NationBuilder value the speaks most clearly to me is the importance of people connecting and communicating with one another and the power of the internet to make that happen more easily.
```

Last night I received lovely responses from Sean Murphy, Rocky, and KeithR.  I think we'll be ok.  I responded to each of them today.

I did a followup email to Jilt to say thank you.

I got an email from a recruiter from Mirror Placement who has what he thinks will be a good match with UserTesting.  At first glance, they may be, but they are looking for a senior dev.  I responded to Jonathan at MP with this:
```
Thank you for reaching out.  I am indeed currently in the market for my next remote position.  I consider myself a mid-level ruby and rails developer, with senior-level testing experience, and some devops experience as well.  I've attached my resume to give you an idea of my skills.  Also, here is my LinkedIn, which will give you a broader view of my experience, https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanprestage/.  

I am having issues with my phone at the moment, but would be happy to connect using the online tool of your preference.

I look forward to talking with you further.
```

We'll see what happens.


## Mon 5/20/2019
I spent most of the weekend helping Kai study for his first trimester's exams.   I spent the rest of it on self care and brainstorming and composing the begging letter.  

I got an email from Jilt late last night, saying I was a strong candidate and did I get the email with the questions.  I bit the bullet and responded with the answers and a plea for another way to do the phone calls since I'm having phone issues.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm grateful that Catherine emailed her encouraging letter.

I wrote the begging email to Keithr, Mike & Laurie, Nartano, Neighbor Susan, Rocky, Sean Murphy, and Craig.  I don't seem to have Matt Clinton's email, so I'll send his through FB Messenger shortly.  Not yet, since several of the folks I emailed are currently logged into FB and I can't quite face them in chat yet.  No email responses yet.

Shit!  I checked my account balance to discover that I have only $200 left.  This isn't nearly what is needed to catch up on my AT&T bill.  This also brings my job search to a complete halt.  

Got the Jilt stuff done, though not sent in since I have no phone for them to call me on the next step.  

Didn't get anything else done because I am devastated by the state of my finances.  What am I going to do.  Shit!


## Thu 5/16/2019
- [x] Investigating NationBuilder from WeWorkRemotely.  Looks good.  Apply tomorrow with cover letter.

I am trying to apply to a new company every day in addition to following up with companies that contact me.  It is an challenging goal, but very necessary at this point.

PowerToFly listings are thining out.  Starting to look at WeWorkRemotely.

Good afternoon,

I am a mid-level ruby on rails developer with senior level experience in test and the computer industry in general. The last couple of years have given me the chance to create APIs from the design document stage through deployment and support of our client's use and requests for additional features and bugfixes.  While seeking my next position, I am in the early stages of designing an API to track power outages in my area, with a frontend to give folks a way to submit outages by neighborhood and date/time as well as display outages over time.

I consider myself a lifelong learner and enjoy picking up new skills and ideas.  I would love a chance to chat to see if we might be a good match.
```

## Wed 5/15/2019
- Got to the next level at Jilt (there are several, all enumerated in their confirmation email...a very nice setting of expectations).  Here are the questions to answer:

- [x] 1) Can you summarize your remote work experience?
My last three jobs have involved remote work.  The first two were entirely remote for all employees.  The most recent one allowed me to convert to remote after working in the office for 22 months.  Slack has been the primary medium for daily communication, collaboration, and general bonding with my teammates.  Daily standups have been conducted in Google Hangouts, Skype, and Go To Meeting.  These video conferencing tools are also useful when there is a feature or issue that needs to be broken down into smaller tasks or the workflow identified.  Interestingly, I've found that email is not used nearly as much in remote work environments.   Remote interactions require folks to intentionally reach out to each other to make technical and personal interactions to connect with your workmates and I have found this to be rather successful.  It has been fun to work with someone in person after working for months only online to discover that you already have a good working relationship that is then strengthened by the in person opportunity.  Slack and its ability for many different channels has proven to be an excellent tool to enhance these connections.

- [x] 2) What is metaprogramming? Provide an example of metaprogramming in practice. Discuss the tradeoffs inherent in metaprogramming.
There are different types of metaprogramming.  One is called "monkey patching".  This is where you add or alter existing behavior.  The danger is when you try to add behavior to, for example, a class.  For example, if the method you are trying to add already exists, you can cause some difficult to diagnose errors elsewhere in your code.  Sometimes though, when an issue is being introduced by an outside library that is needed, a little well chosen monkey patching can correct for those externally caused issues.

- [x] 3) What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important in web development? When might you take an asynchronous approach, and what are the drawbacks in doing so?
Asynchronous programming allows your code to spin off an additional thread that runs concurrently with the main body of your program.  If this additional thread is manipulating data that the main body depends on, there can be issues with the data becomming out of sync.  However, asynchronous programming can be a useful tool for providing a good user experience while the actual work is being done in the background.  It is important to note the difference between asynchronous programming and concurrent programming, where the first is doing task A while waiting for task B to complete and second is doing task C and task D simultaneously.

- [x] 4) What programming best practice do you disagree with?
I have two that come up a lot.  The first is:
`No spaces after (, [ or before ], )`, https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide#spaces-braces.  My last CTO very strongly felt there should be spaces inside parentheses and square brackets.  I came to agree over time as I found code in this style to be much easier to read.  It is not the norm though and I would modify my style as needed.  
The second is a strong preference to indent my `when`s in a `case` block, https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide#indent-when-to-case.  I feel it is much easier to read and debug, especially for a big `case` block.

- [x] 5) What does great code look like to you? Can you provide a link to an example?
This is my favorite example of great code, https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11.  It is in assembly.  It is roughly 50 years old.  It is well documented.  For something more modern and in Ruby, I like code that Ryan Davis is heavily involved in like this, https://github.com/zenspider/minitest.

- [ ] 6) Review this code -- what improvements or changes would you make? Please create a new Gist or attach a file with your changes.
*First pass complete.  Review again before submitting*  https://gist.github.com/sprestage/c8a6596eae7e9a7b1eef285f97625892

- [x] 7) Tabs or spaces? 😀
I prefer spaces and tend to map the tab key in Atom to 2 spaces.  This is simply a style difference though and the style guide for the team should indicate which is preferred.  I believe the dev team should be in sync on which is used regardless of which style is chosen.

- [x] 8) If you were hiring someone for this position, what salary range would you set?
80-95k, depending on experience.

## Tue 5/14/2019
- Applied to Jilt
- Silverfin was recommended by PowerToFly, but I do not qualify _we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)_
- Digital Ocean's Sr Web Dev position is closed...reported to PtF


## Mon 5/13/2019
- Investigating Jilt/SkyVerge through PowerToFly.  Company values look very good.  Proceed with application...after I get something to eat, since I'm getting dizzy.
### companies to watch for future openings
- Logikcull.  Excellent opening interview.  They found another match before I could get to the next interview.  Watch these guys for future openings since they look like a really good remote match.  

## Wed 5/8/2019
Working on api that adds locations and times to a data base to track power outages; investigate the use of google maps api.
- [x] Research the google maps api to find out what I'm getting into.  This will also help identify what kinds of data I will need to store.
- Consider starting this API by using neighborhood names, with static images of the neighborhoods.  Plan to implement use of Google maps for a future version.  This has the advantage of getting the API up and running first, then adding more functionality once input from potential users is collected.

## Fri 5/3/2019
- Logikcull SW Engineer position is filled.  Applied for senior position.  Cover letter: Good afternoon.  I found you through the PowerToFly site and very much like the company culture I'm seeing in your website.  I am a mid-level ruby on rails developer with senior level experience in test and the computer industry in general.  The last couple of years have given me the chance to create APIs from the design document stage through deployment and support of our client's use and requests for additional features and bugfixes.  I would love a chance to chat to see if I might be a good match for Logikcull now or in the future.  
- :(  Preparing to apply to Loco2 first thing Monday morning.  Cover letter: PowerToFly brought Loco2 to my attention.  Further research shows...Due to American labour laws we unfortunately cannot accept applications from the United States.  
Over the years, I have enjoyed working with team members in Poland, Bulgaria, and Colombia, using Slack and various chat applications for meetings and technological collaborations.  I have some French, growing Spanish, and a little German as well, though I do better with these in writing than speaking so far, though that is quickly changing with my Spanish as I am a US citizen currently living in Panamá.  I am an early riser and live quietly in the mountain town of Boquete which gives me the freedom to accommodate an eccentric schedule in order to work with my teammates.  Reading through your description of your company culture, I see a delightful similarity to the best of teams I have worked with in the past and hope to work with in the future.  Making a variety of different kinds of travel bookings at Expedia in order to test payments could also add to the skills I would like to bring to Loco2.
-

## Thu 5/2/2019
- applied to Rick Steves Europe in Edmonds, general application as there are no engineering positions currently available
- Logikcull, good company values, volunteers, donates, plants trees, supportive of families; they say to watch for future positions as they are growing

## where to get tilapia fingerlings and juvenile shrimp in Panamá
- shrimp, http://www.gfarallon.com/index.php/laboratorios
- tilapia, http://panamaquaculture.com/noticias/

It looks like I would need to email each of them to get further information on how to purchase.  I also don't know if I need to be a business to interact with them.  I hope not, since I want to start this project as a hobby before I turn it into a business.  

## goals
First, feed my family.  Second, donate extra to those without enough food in Boquete.  Third, create a small business and sell/market at the TMM.  

I want to make this operation easy to maintain and especially to plant and harvest.  I want to be able to still work this operation when I'm 70 or 80.  That means that everything needs to be at a height that is easy to work with, not down on the ground where I must sit or kneel for hours on end.  

Another goal is to learn how to build this operation here in Panamá with inexpensive parts.  Then to get the operation up and running successfully, first with tilapia and then with shrimp.  Once I work out all the bugs in the system, I'm interested in setting up an operation up in King County, perhaps with Kirsten/Hazel as a manager.  The operation in King County would be intended to be a money-making operation, unlike the one in Panamá.
