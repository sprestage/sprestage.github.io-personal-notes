- financial, list of things needed that cost money to buy or implement or install or make: https://gist.github.com/sprestage/a68dd09f133250d97971de69065d0d62. Needs a little updating to convert it to my current needs, particularly that of creating the prioritized list of things needed to be done or bought

---

As soon as the Open Keyboard feature is available on the POS, I need to share out my business cards to everyone.  Make a list of who.  Luis, Nicole, Al & Day, Al & Sela, Kevin, Oscar, ask Adelina if we can give them to Jackie.

As soon as I catch up on Business tasks, I need to spend my mornings prepping my resume for a computer industry job search.  QA/Dev Test this time I think since I need a job quickly and the interviews are much easier on my psyche and confidence.  Also need to write up a quick blurb on what I've been doing and why I'm returning to the industry.  Think elevator speach.

- Spanish learning (ESP)
- Household everything (DOM)
- Current debts (PAY)
- (JOB) was job search, now is retired

Last minute car rental at the end of the day.  Bringing back sometime mid-morning on Sunday.  Erg.


## Thu, 15 Jul 2021
### office containers
Exciting day.  The containers are arriving at the business property.  Long story short, the landlord raised the rent on the guy storing them, so he needs to move, which means so do the containers.

### POS deposit questions
YIKES!  Need to contact POS rep at the bank to figure out how to release a deposit.  Also check on how long a hold is maintained...is it there until released or does it auto-release after a certain amount of days.  If it auto releases, how to I handle a long rental, like 1, 3, or 6 months?

Message sent to Carlos and we are conversing back and forth to teach me what to do.  

### Kai's mental health
Kai opened up to me the other night about how he is struggling with his mental health, in particular with depression and with anger management.  I've reached out the the gal who did his psych eval for school to get a recommendation for a therapist for youth with very good English.


## Mon, 12 Jul 2021
- [x] DOM - shower
- [x] KSR - 8am car rental pickup at Valle Escondido
- [x] PRO - update LinkedIn with OCP and non-availability
- [x] PRO - update PowerToFly with OCP and non-availability
- [x] DOM - paid iPhone
- [x] KSR - prepare document for Fanny, with logo <- IMPORTANTE
- [ ] KSR - REFUND DEPOSIT!!! <- IMPORTANTE

Phone details:

I used the phone number and pay account tab to pay for each of these:

- [x] DOM - 311020190000 = business phone, 6393-2521. paid $13.83, 12/07/21, service/account #1678356 (in email receipt of payment)
- [x] DOM - Susan's phone, 6330 5175, paid $28.39, 12/07/21, service/account #1678296 (in email receipt of payment)
- [x] DOM - 311019100000 = Kai's phone (I think), 6671-8724, paid $62.66, 12/07/21, service/account #311019100000 (in email receipt of payment)

I have confirmed that all three PA phone accounts are up to date for payment.  :D

On 18 June, account #1638746 was paid $74.48.  I *think* this is the house internet.  I see another payment mentioned in these notes on 4 July as well.  Thing is, the 18 June payment has this in the email note: "Pago Contrato +Móvil", so I'm not sure which payment this is except that these notes say I paid all the phones plus the internet on 4 july...however this was a post that looked like a catch-up after a week of no posts, so I'm not sure how current those checked items were.

Here is hoping next month's payments and emails will help all this become more clear.  Good research today, just a bit more needed.

Uh, wow!  That was fast, fast.  One Click Politics offered me a job at 80k before the end of Friday.  Apparently Maged really liked our interview and wanted me as one of the 4 new people.  Time to wrap up the job search and email everyone the news.

- [x] JOB - chat with Kaitlin Lockwood with JumpSmart talent who has a Backend Software Engineer for an international financial services company based in San Francisco role available; 1pm by phone
- [x] JOB - meet with Maged from One Click Politics at 11am by Zoom
- [x] JOB - immediately after the chat with One Click Politics, phone Dan Voigt at his office (I sure do hope the Google Voice works for this!)
- [x] JOB - send resume to Kaitlin Lockwood with JumpSmart Talent
- [x] DOM - pay for Kai's psicologia appointment
- [x] DOM - some laundry
- [x] DOM - put away clothes into the closet
- [x] DOM - clean more shoes

Questions for Maged from One Click Politics:

- What does a team look like in your company?
- How do you regularly sync up with a team and across teams?  Daily or weekly stand ups?
- How big is the engineering department and how is its diversity?
- What are the politics like within the company?  In the sense that this is a passionate group of folks with strong ideals that are often different, so how does that play out in the office?

4 existing; hiring 3

I went into this interview concerned that the company would be East Coast, right leaning, with uncomfortable politics.  I was also concerned because this is listed as a senior role.  I came out of the interview feeling like politics will be polite, the engineers are mostly left leaning geeks like myself.  They will definitely be happy with my diverse range of skills.  And it sounds like their tech and where they are going tech-wise is a good fit.  I'm definitely interested in going forward and told Maged (OCP) and Dan Voigt (G12 Staffing) the same.


Next up is my phone meeting with Kaitlin Lockwood with JumpSmart Talent who has a Backend Software Engineer for an international financial services company based in San Francisco role available.  

- what is their tech stack
- is full time remote possible, with 1-2 weeks spent in office every 3 months more or less?

ruby/rails

Full time & remote.  branch.co

- [x] JOB - meet with Mike DeWolf from User Interviews

- [x] DOM - clean some shoes

Had a great 30 minute interview with Mike DeWolf from User Interviews.  They do things in many ways very like Sportsrocket in all the good ways, including the coding interview.  He said we'd be going forward and would try to schedule the coding interview for next week.  The coding interview is a pull request prepared for the interview.  This is followed by an architecture/design interview where you work together to design a solution for a technical problem.

Had a good 30 minute interview with Pal from Bitwise.  Notes from call:

Build and scale company in general.  Eng provides products to help operations scale.  manage clients, tool for ops to trade and manage portfolios, no business tooling currently, data pipelines that clean then enable analysis.

It does sound like they are looking for someone of diverse experience, but some weaknesses (like my front end work) are fine too.  He needs to check about me being out of the country and asked for a written writeup that he can use to check up with legal.  I'd need to be interested in learning crypto technology (Bitcoin, Etherium, et al) which sounds cool to me.  The next step would be a longer call with his CTO to test my skills, then a half day where we collaborate on a piece of work, which I find to be a splendid way to see if we can work together.

- [x] DOM - buy more eggs
- [x] DOM - clear out a bunch of compost from the fridge
- [x] DOM - wash the tupperware from clearing the fridge
- [x] JOB - update ruby on tech blog and deploy to new Heroku stack; ok, this has turned out to be more involved than I'd hoped.  Which in some ways is good as it will refresh my skills for how to put together a blog site checked into github and deployed to Heroku.  The first complication is that the ruby used in my old blogs is 2.2.1.  The Heroku stack that can support ruby that old is end-of-life by 2 years.  The next complication is that octopress hasn't been maintained since 2015.  Jekyll, the base for octopress, is still being maintained.  As I understand it, the pretty style of my current blogs is because of octopress, so I'll have some porting of code to do in order to affect the same look and feel, or roughly so anyway.  Need to make tasks for this.  

Ashley, FB:

She needs to talk to folks about the Panama aspect since I'd need to be fully remote except occasional trips north.  This isn't usually ok, but it may be time for that to change and for me to lead the charge on this.  Her contact is out, so she'll try to get back to me by Friday but definitely by early next week.  If all works out, the next steps would be:

- 45 min tech (coding interview)  CS fundamentals  (mock interview videos, actual mock interview w/ feedback, material reviews)
- the full interview, 2 coding, 2 architecture/design, 1 cultural

Facebook works hard to prepare candidates for the technical interviews ahead of time so all are able to shine to the best of their abilty.

Spoke with Dan Voigt about the company.  Sounds like a great fit.  They may be concerned that I live outside of the US.  He will speak to them further.  Company called One Trick Root or One Trick Politics.  They start with an interview w/ director, then do a 15-20 min code exercise.  If that goes well, they schedule a virtual team meeting for introductions and testing culture/tech fit.  Dan will contact me tomorrow morning with an update.

- [x] DOM - took care of Little Bit
- [x] DOM - went to Jungla Panama with Kai
- [x] DOM - took nap

Even more underslept after only 2.5 hour naps all night between feedings.  Little Bit is showing good strength and energy when he's awake.  Still no elimination.  I watered down the formula mix by third feeding yesterday at Heather's recommendation.  Once or twice mid or late feeding he grasps the tiny syringe and takes a good drink.  His nuzzling around is a clear indicator of a wish and preference for nursing from mom, sadly to no avail. Upon hearing the story, Adelina said her son knew of a wildlife rescue, Jungla Panama in Palmira Centro, only 10 mins away.  Contact made with Dorothy on WhatsApp.  Sent her a picture so she knew that Little Bit was a black squirrel, or Variegated Squirrel which have a mutation for black in western Panama.  

I figured less than an hour there and then return.  Over two hours later, we got into the car for me to realize I had missed my Spanish lesson completely.  Whoops.  Jungla was amazing.  Sweet old tiny blind pony, dogs, many many cats, ducks, goats, a turtle, 3 macaws and a smaller green parrot of some sort, two different owls, an adult female squirrel who had formerly been someone's pet so can be released, a kinkajoo, a couple of small fish, and 2 monkeys.  The squirrel didn't like to be pet, but was perfectly willing to sit up on any part of you while eating sunflower seeds.  Quite expert at hanging upside down in the awesome enclosure that I hope Little Bit will live to grow up in while preparing to be a wild squirrel.

Underslept today.  At 3am, I heard the first baby squirrel.  At 4am, I rescued the uninjured 2nd baby squirrel, Little Bit.  He was warm by 6am for first feeding.  Feeding every 2-3 hours with milk replacer I had on hand from Sunsinger's failed litter.  No elimination yet in spite of much stimulation with qtip, warm washcloth, and warm bath for his lower body.  Becomes physically quite active during elimination attempts and feeding time, he has good strength for his size and age.  I'm hopeful.  Ended day with nearly 1cc milk consumed at each feeding.  Cute little burring sound.  When he's done feeding he curls into a ball for his next long nap.  Very age appropriate.  Contacted Tamra and Heather early on and their advice concurred with all I'd been reading in the wee hours while Little Bit was warming up in my palm tented with soft warm flannel.

Here I am one week later.  No applications out to potential jobs yet, though I have done some searching and have found some likely candidates I need to apply to.  I've spent this time diving back into code and AWS and rake task scripting in the process of getting the Unofficial Trakehner DB site back up.  This site is the best example of my skills, so I felt it was important to get it back into a viewable condition.  I have everything working locally, with images and thumbnails and horses imported.  Now I'm working on getting it all deployed to Heroku.  Once that is done, I first need to freshen my resume up on my Portfolio site.  Then I need to update LinkedIn and a few other sites with my current job interests, SDET or QA or dev, plus my updated resume.  Then the search can begin.  Should be ready by Friday, I think.  Depends on how the Portfolio deployment goes.  Other side projects need to include getting the journey and the technical blogs deployed on new stacks.  This will mean upgrading the octopress blogs from ruby 2.2.1.
